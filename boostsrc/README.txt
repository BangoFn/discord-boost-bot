	* First make sure you have your bot token and everything need for this, turn on developer mode in your discord client if you havent already.
	  (You can get your bot token from https://discord.com/developers/applications)

	* Second, in main.py scroll all the way down to line 505

	    a) Open Command Prompt and type in "wmic csproduct get uuid" it should output your uuid.
	    b) Go to pastebin and paste your hwid & create a new paste.
	    c) Copy the link and replace in main.py

	* Replace your bot token, guild id & your own id inside settings.json

	* Type https://capmonster.cloud in your browser and create a new account (this is for solving captchas, you MUST have money on the account for your key  to work.)

	* Enter Capmonster Cloud API key into settings.json aswell. (Create a ticket in the discord if you'd like to use my key $3)
	
	* Upload the emojis in /boostsrc/emojis to your discord server for the emojis to show up. (I will also help with this aswell just create a ticket in the discord)
