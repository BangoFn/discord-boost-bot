	* First make sure you have your bot token and everything need for this, turn on developer mode in your discord client if you havent already.
	  (You can get your bot token from https://discord.com/developers/applications)

	   a) Make sure you have extracted the files to your desktop or somewhere you know how to access its directory.
	   b) Open Command Prompt and type in "wmic csproduct get uuid" it should output your uuid.
	   c) Send the hwid to me on either one of the support tags below to be whitelisted.

	* Replace your bot token, guild id & your own id inside settings.json

	* Type https://capmonster.cloud in your browser and create a new account (this is for solving captchas, you MUST have money on the account for your key to work, I also sell my key for a low price of $2)

	* Enter Capmonster Cloud API key into settings.json aswell. (Create a ticket in the discord if you'd like to use my key)
